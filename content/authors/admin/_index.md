I am a Senior Lecturer in the Department of Politics and Public Administration at the University of Limerick. 

In my research, I study the involvement and interactions of politicians and bureaucrats in legislative decision-making as well as their relative influence on policy processes and outcomes, mainly in the context of the European Union. I am also interested in classic political science questions about the historical development of political parties, electoral competition, and democratic institutions more broadly.

This site provides information about my research and publications. It also provides access to data sets and other research outputs I have collected.
