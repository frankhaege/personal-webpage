title: Historical German Election Manifestos
summary: Election manifestos are one of the primary sources of information for measuring the positions of political parties. In this data collection project, I collect and digitize historical election appeals of German political parties, as published in newspapers at the time, from 1867 to 1933. The temporal scope of this document corpus enables new research on the origins and long-term development of political parties and political conflict structures.
