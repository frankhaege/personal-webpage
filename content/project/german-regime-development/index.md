title: Democratisation and De-Democratisation in Imperial Germany
summary: This project examines the economic and political factors that influenced the initial constitutional design of the German Empire and subsequent attempts to reform the regime into a more democratic or autocratic direction. Taking into account both long-term developments in economic structures and ideological beliefs, as well as short-term actor constellations within a particular institutional context, the project takes a novel approach for understanding historical regime change trajectories.
