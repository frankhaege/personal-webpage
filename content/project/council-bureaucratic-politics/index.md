title: Bureaucratic Politics in the Council of the European Union
summary: Beginning with my PhD dissertation, several of my studies examine the role played by diplomats and other national officials in shaping the process and outcome of decision-making in the Council of the European Union. Collectively, they help to improve our understanding of the internal decision-making process of the Council, which has long been seen as a 'black box'.
