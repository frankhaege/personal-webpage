abstract: 'The Presidency of the Council is one of the most important leadership positions in the institutional setup of the European Union
(EU). Yet, the treaties defining this institutional setup are largely silent on the Presidency’s powers, roles, and functions.
Apart from a single paragraph in the Treaty
on European Union, which limits office holders
to member state representatives and establishes
equal rotation as the general selection
principle for filling the post, the treaties
just mention that “the Council shall meet
when convened by its President . . .” (Article
237, Treaty on the Functioning of the
European Union, Official Journal of the
European Union, 2012). Thus, little can
be learned about the Presidency from reading
the formal constitutional rulebook. 


Research
on the Council Presidency endeavors to shed
more light on the Presidency’s roles, functions,
and powers in Council negotiations
and the EU decision-making process more
broadly. It does so by examining the causes
and effects of lower-level formal rules, informal
norms, and behavioral practices that have
been established over time. The Presidency
fulfills key tasks in the organization and management
of the Council’s work as well as its
external representation by exercising a number
of procedural prerogatives and administrative
resources that put it in an advantageous
position vis-à-vis other member states. 


The fact that the Presidency can potentially use its
elevated position in the Council’s decisionmaking
process to advance its own private
interests raises two interlinked questions:
First, why do member states grant the
Presidency these powers, if they can potentially
be used to their disadvantage? Second,
is the Presidency actually able to use these
powers to advance its own policy priorities
and preferences? Not surprisingly, much research on the
Council Presidency has focused on these two
questions, and this review is organized
around theoretical and empirical answers to
them.'
