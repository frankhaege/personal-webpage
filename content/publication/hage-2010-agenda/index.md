abstract: "The European Commission is often considered to be the main agenda-setter in EU policymaking.
The Commission produces hundreds of policy documents every year. However,
reliable quantitative accounts of the agenda-setting activity of the Commission over extended
periods of time and across several policy areas are not available. We need such accounts if
we want to be able to adjudicate between competing theories of the role of the Commission in
the European integration process. While information on the Commissionâ€™s agenda-setting
activity is now in principle available in online databases such as PreLex, a major problem is
the absence of a comprehensive policy classification scheme with mutually exclusive
categories. For a considerable number of documents in PreLex, policy labels are either
missing or several labels are assigned to a single document, making the classification
ambiguous. In this study, I conduct classification experiments to investigate the performance
of computer-assisted document classification methods for generating correct policy labels for
Commission documents solely based on the words in their titles. The findings indicate that
the support vector machine classifier is able to classify about 75 percent of the documents
into the correct policy category, regardless of which combination of pre-processing options
are chosen to generate the input matrix for the analysis."
