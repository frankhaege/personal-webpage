abstract: "Now in its eighth edition, this seminal work on the
organisation, working methods, and powers of the European
Parliament (EP) is fully revised to take into account
the changes resulting from the 2009 European elections
and the entry into force of the Lisbon treaty. Similar to
earlier editions, the book is divided into three parts.


Part 1 provides ‘The Framework’, describing the main
features of the EP in comparison to other legislatures
and how Members of the European Parliament (MEPs)
are being elected. It also discusses issues arising from
the EP’s commitment to multilingualism and the distribution
of its work between Strasbourg, Luxembourg,
and Brussels. 


Part 2 deals with ‘The Actors and Working
Structures’, starting with the background, role, and
motivations of individual MEPs. Subsequent chapters
deal with the composition, organisation, and operation
of political groups, the EP leadership, committees, interparliamentary
delegations, the plenary, intergroups, and
the secretariat, respectively. 


Part 3 covers ‘The
Powers of the Parliament’. This part includes chapters
on the role and prerogatives of the EP in the legislative
process, in the adoption of the budget, in the appointment
and dismissal of the Commission and the leadership of
other EU organisations and agencies, and in scrutinizing
delegated and implementing acts of the Commission.
Other chapters outline Parliaments connections and
communication channels to other European Union (EU)
institutions and its openness towards interest groups,
media, and ordinary citizens, as well as the role of national
parliaments in EU law-making and their relations
to the EP before and after the Lisbon treaty. 


Finally, the
book concludes with a discussion of how the EP affected
constitutional change over the years through its influence
on successive treaty reforms."
