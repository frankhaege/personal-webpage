abstract: 'Negotiations in the Council of the European Union take place in an environment that is
relatively unstructured by formal rules and procedures. Indeed, most of the negotiations take
place in working parties and committees composed of national officials and diplomats that
‘prepare’ the Council’s work. In other words, decisions are being made in fora that are not
recognized by the European Treaties, by government representatives that possess no formal
powers to do so, and according to unwritten rules and procedures that have largely developed
through practice over time rather than intentional design. Even though formal provisions,
such as the voting rule, may have indirect effects on negotiators’ behaviour, they often do not
reflect decision-making in practice. To shed more light on the negotiation process in the
Council, this paper presents a quantitative case study of negotiations on the Air Quality
Directive. To capture the complexity of multi-issue, multi-actor negotiations over time, the
study describes the negotiation process as a series of two-mode networks consisting of
member states and their negotiation positions. The statistical analysis focuses on two aspects
of this process, the number of negotiation positions stated by member states and the
propensity of those positions being incorporated into the legal text. The results suggest that
larger countries state more negotiation positions than smaller ones, and that the size of the
group supporting a negotiation position is an important determinant in explaining its
incorporation into the final agreement. Furthermore, these relationships are stable across
stages of the negotiation process and different decision-making fora of the Council,
suggesting that negotiation behaviour in informal settings is not qualitatively distinct from
negotiation behaviour in more formal arenas.'
