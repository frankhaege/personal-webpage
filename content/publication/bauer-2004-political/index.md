abstract: 'The past two decades have witnessed a significant realignment
of the roles of the state and the private sector in infrastructure
industries. Using telecommunications as an example,
the study takes advantage of this “natural experiment”
to review the explanatory power of the veto player
model both theoretically and empirically. At a theoretical
level, we point out that one of the great advantages of the
veto player model, its parsimony, is at the same time its
weakness. This conclusion is solidified by our empirical
results. In contrast to earlier work that uses the number of
significant laws as the dependent variable, the paper develops
a multi-dimensional measure of the legal and institutional
transformation. We find that the simple veto player
model does not explain the empirical pattern of reforms.
An augmented model that differentiates between collective
and competitive veto players has much higher explanatory
power. Moreover, we find that the structural configuration
of the interest group system helps explain the dynamics as
well as the extent of sector transformation.'
