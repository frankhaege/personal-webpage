abstract: "Research on the intra-institutional consequences of differences in the EU’s interinstitutional
rule configurations is rare. This study investigates the effect of the
empowerment of the European Parliament (EP) on the active involvement of ministers
in Council decision-making. The empowerment of the EP is likely to increase the
incentives for bureaucrats in the Council’s preparatory bodies to refer decisions on
legislative dossiers to ministers. The empirical analysis examines this claim with data on
about 6,000 legislative decision-making processes that were concluded between 1980
and the end of 2007. The analysis demonstrates a strong and robust association between
the type of legislative procedure and different decision-making levels in the Council: a
more powerful EP makes Council decision-making more politicised."
