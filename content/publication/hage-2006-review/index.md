abstract: "In this book, Joseph Jupille sets out a theory of procedural politics, defined as
the ‘everyday conduct of politics not within, but with respect to, political
institutions’. The theory is applied to explain the selection of treaty bases,
where these treaty bases imply different procedures for legislation to be passed,
in the European Union (EU)."
