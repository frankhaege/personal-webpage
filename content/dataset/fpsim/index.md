title: Chance-Corrected Measures of Foreign Policy Similarity (FPSIM Version 2) Data
summary: "The FPSIM (version 2) dataset provides measures of foreign policy similarity of dyads based on alliance ties (Correlates of War, version 4.1) and UN General Assembly voting (Voeten, version 17) for all members of the international system (Correlates of War system membership list, version 5.0). The alliance data cover the time period from 1816 to 2012, and the UN voting data from 1946 to 2015."

The FPSIM (version 2) dataset provides measures of foreign policy similarity of dyads based on alliance ties (Correlates of War, version 4.1) and UN General Assembly voting (Voeten, version 17) for all members of the international system (Correlates of War system membership list, version 5.0). The alliance data cover the time period from 1816 to 2012, and the UN voting data from 1946 to 2015. 


The similarity measures include various versions of Ritter and Signorino's *S* (weighted/non-weighted by material capabilities; squared/absolute distance metrics) as well as the chance-corrected measures Cohen's $\kappa$ and Scott's $\pi$. The measures based on alliance data come in two versions: one is based on valued alliance ties and the other is based on binary alliance ties.


Next to the archived version on the dataverse (see link above), the data are also (potentially more easily) accessible through the R package [{peacesciencer}](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/peacesciencer/index.html) created by [Steven V. Miller](http://svmiller.com/peacesciencer/) (see this [introductory article](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/07388942221077926?journalCode=cmpb)).
