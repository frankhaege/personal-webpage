This dataset provides the date, duration, and policy coding of more than 70,000 meetings of Council working parties, committees and ministerial formations in the Council of the European Union, covering all areas of its policy activities between 1995 and 2014. In terms of both scope and resolution, the data allow for the generation of unprecedented insights into what issues occupy the Council's agenda, how that varies between and within policy areas, and how that changes over time. It also documents the birth, merger, split, succession, or death of working parties and committees, providing novel insights about changes in the organisational structure of the Council over time.
